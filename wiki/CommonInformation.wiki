!SliderBar on picture above includes two 'more' elements and one 'less' element (except scale and drag).

Less widget, More widget, Scale widget and Drag widget are common GWT widgets (descendant of Widget class). This widgets must implement following interfaces:

|| *Widget* || *Interfaces* ||
|| Less widget || !HasMouseDownHandlers ||
|| More widget || !HasMouseDownHandlers ||
|| Scale widget || !HasMouseDownHandlers ||
|| Drag widget || !HasMouseDownHandlers, !HasMouseUpHandlers, !HasMouseMoveHandlers ||

Some integer value corresponds to each position of Drag widget. Zero corresponds to leftmost position of horizontal !SliderBar or topmost position of vertical !SliderBar. Value which corresponds to rightmost position of Drag widget of horizontal !SliderBar or bottommost position of vertical !SliderBar is defined by User.

We can see which value will be correspond to different Drag widget position for horizontal !SliderBar if user sets max value, which corresponds to rightmost knob position, to 7. 

It is possible to interracr with scrollbars by all availabble means:

  # drag knob 
  # clic mouse on scale or on scale arrows
  # use arrow keys on clipboard

When position of knob is changed '!BarValueChangedEvent' is fired. You cen react to this event by adding '!BarValueChangedHandler'  hasndler to !SliderBar.
